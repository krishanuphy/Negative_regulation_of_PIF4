Instruction to get the code: Click on the 'Code' menu (green color) and from the drop-down menu, choose the option 'Download Zip'. Then extract it in any directory of your desktop. The function code and main code should be in the same directory. You need to run the main code in your installed MATLAB software.

Instruction to run the code: You have to open the code through MATLAB software ( 'MATLAB' software has to be installed in your PC). All the parameter values are already given in the code. You can also change those parameter values as well as the initial values. Finally you will get the solutions of the two differential equations and the corresponding plot. You will get Figure (2)B in a single plot.
